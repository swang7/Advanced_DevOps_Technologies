# ElfGetCalibration.py

Python script to calculate the *sum of all of the calibration values* hidden in the Elf's calbiration file

## ElfGetTrueCalibration.sh

Bash script to calculate the *sum of all the accurate calibration values* hidden in the Elf's calbiration file

## calibration.txt

The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific *calibration value* that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the *first digit* and the *last digit* (in that order) to form a single *two-digit number*.  Each line will have at least 1 digit.

## How to run

```python3 ElfGetCalibration.py calibration.txt```

```bash ElfGetTrueCalibration.sh calibration.txt```
